Banshee music player does not let user to move files while preserving the rating and other information

This project lets user move a file or a directory and also updates the location of the files in Banshee database.

At the moment you can: 
1. move a file from one location to another 
2. move all files from a specified directory to another existing directory 
3. move all files from a specified directory to a new directory

Known issues: 
* does not support moving nested directories

Instructions that I have sent to the first user of this program:

The program is written using Scala but you do not have to have Scala installed on your system to use the program (explanation below).

The build system used is maven.

So the prerequisites to build are:
* install Open JDK (I am using V6)
* install Maven (I am using version 2.21)

Process:
* go to the top level directory of the checkout git project (you have cloned it to your local driver, right?)
* this directory contains pom.xml - that's the definition file for Maven
* now execute a command: mvn package
* the above command is going to download all the dependencies (Scala jar files, sqlite jar and a few others), then it will compile and package the program.
* now go to the directory target/appassembler/bin
* execute the musicmover.sh by invoking the following command: sh musicmover.sh

WARNING AND DISCLAIMER!!! :) 
1. Please make sure that you back up your file ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db
2. I have used this program myself several times and it worked for me well but I have upgraded to Banshee 2.2.1 and it seems to be doing job of monitoring the files moves from one directory to another quite well for me so I stopped usaing this program myself.
3. You are the first user apart from me that I am aware of, so good luck!
